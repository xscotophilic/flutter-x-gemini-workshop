# Prerequisites for Flutter Development with VS Code

This document outlines the necessary steps to set up your development environment for Flutter using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## 5. Verify Installation

1.  **Create a new Flutter project:**
    - In VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
    - Type "Flutter: New Project" and select it.
    - Choose a location for your project and enter a project name.
    - Wait for the project to be created.
2.  **Run the project:**
    - Open the `lib/main.dart` file.
    - Connect a physical device or start an emulator/simulator.
    - Click "Run > Start Debugging" (or press `F5`).
    - The Flutter app should launch on your device or emulator.

If you see the default Flutter counter app running, your Flutter development environment is set up correctly.
